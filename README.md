## Example Code

You can include code snippets in your `README.md` file using code blocks. Here's an example:

```python
def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

greeting("World")
```

The above code will output `Hello, World!` when executed.

````

Make sure to replace the code within the code block with your actual code. You can specify the programming language after the opening triple backticks (\```), which will enable syntax highlighting for that language in most Markdown viewers.

Once you've added the code block to your `README.md` file, it will be displayed as a formatted code snippet when viewed on platforms like GitHub or other Markdown renderers.

Remember to remove the leading backtick (\`) from the closing triple backticks to end the code block properly.

Hope this helps!
